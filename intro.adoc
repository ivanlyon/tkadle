* To tkadle this file, use the command "tkadle.tcl -syn asciidoc intro.adoc"
* To expand all folded items in tkadle, press "+" a few times
* Keyboard arrow keys are the intended means of navigating the list
* Press F1 to see a help dialog
* Alternate views of the tkadle gui
    ** <Control+D> displays the Deleted items per session (Empty at start)
    ** <Control+E> displays the Export view
    ** <Control+O> displays the Options view
* Possible use cases for tkadle
    ** Regular editing of a todo list (Especially as a startup application)
    ** Editing of lists in larger asciidoc to be accessed by "include" commands
        *** Example: line "include::intro.adoc[]" in another asciidoc file
* Current limitations of tkadle
    ** No custom numbering of ordered lists
    ** A tkadle input file must be dedicated to list syntax
    ** At this point, tkadle has only been tested and used by 1 person
    ** At this point, tkadle has not been ported beyond Linux
    ** Geometry save between application instantiations is apprx 50 px wrong vertically
* Notable design decisions
    ** tkadle creates its own icon on-the-fly (Maybe there is a reason no one does this?)
    ** tkadle automatically saves a list file after changes are made
    ** Syntax emblems displayed on GUI are naive approximations
    ** List file syntax types were implemented as classes to enable previews
        *** A second object will be used to show a class's preview in Options
        *** This preview has not yet been implemented
    ** A general list class handles any arbitrary text file as a list of lines
    ** Selected tree item ID is brute forced every time...do not know a better way
    ** Single file source code seems best...so far
    ** List file syntax chosen at program start, and considered immutable
    ** Double click on the list may be trained with multiple expectations, (1) select a word, (2) edit a list item. So double click is not handled.
* Future work
    ** Custom color schemes (Already tried, but empty treeview space is always white)
    ** Custom fonts (Somebody, somewhere, is going to ask for monospace)
    ** Create tests?
    ** Porting to Windows and MacOS
    ** Figure out if the "Export" functionality is as cool as I think it is
    ** Slide show of (Every node with descendents) or (Every top level node)
    ** Provide a quick view of elided list items (Balloon, or separate pane by hotkey)
